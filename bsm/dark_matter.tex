Observations on galaxies rotation, seems to suggest that their mass is not
enough to generate the force needed to counteract the effect of the centripetal
force and to prevent them to torn apart~\cite{RotationCurves}. Since observation
suggest that stars and planets in galaxies are not pulled away, we conclude that
there must be extra mass that we cannot see that generate the gravity needed to
hold them together. This unknown matter goes by the name of \emph{dark
  matter}. Dark matter does not interact or interacts weakly with the
electromagnetic force, as a consequence, it does not emit, reflect or absorb
light making it hard to detect. Cosmological measurements on the content of
matter of the universe have been performed~\cite{DMEvidence} that seems to
suggest that the visible matter (the one we can see and measure), only accounts
for 5\% of the total energy of the universe and that dark matter constitutes
roughly the 27\%, the remaining 68\% is called \emph{dark energy} and is even
more puzzling. Some theories~\cite{WIMPIntro} predict that dark matter particles
should be light enough to be produced at hadron colliders but due to their
``dark'' nature, they would escape detection leading to an energy imbalance in
the detector that could be used as an hint of their existence.

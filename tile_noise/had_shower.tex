In a similar way to the electromagnetic shower, hadrons lose energy through
strong interaction with the calorimeter material. The strong interaction is
responsible for the production of energetic secondary hadrons with momenta
typically at the GeV scale and nuclear reactions such as excitation or nucleon
spallation in which neutrons and protons are released from the nuclei with a
characteristic energy at the MeV scale.

The hadron produced are mainly pions, of these, 90\% are neutral pions which
decay to photons ($\pi \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$). The photons produced this
way will initiate an electromagnetic shower as described in
Section~\ref{sec:electr-show} transferring energy from the hadronic part to the
electromagnetic and not contributing any more to hadronic processes. The
nucleons released by excitation or nuclear spallation, require an energy equal
to their binding energy to be released and are not recorded as a contribution to
the calorimeter signal thus producing a form of \emph{invisible energy}. Some
detectors can compensate for the loss of invisible energy, these are called
\emph{compensated calorimeters}~\cite{Calorimetry}.

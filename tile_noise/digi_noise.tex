The digital noise is measured in ADC counts for each PMT in both gains, HG and
LG\@. The noise constants stored are the RMS of the seven samples within each
event, also called \gls{hfn} and the RMS of the first digitized sample in each
event or \gls{lfn}. The digital noise is used for monitoring and for \gls{mc}
noise simulation.

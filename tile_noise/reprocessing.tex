As new information about the detector becomes available, an update of the
calibration constants and thus of the reconstructed energy might take place;
this procedure is called \emph{reprocessing}. In 2011 an update of the laser and
cesium calibration analysis procedure took place thus requiring a recalculation
of the cell noise.

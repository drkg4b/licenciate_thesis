The ATLAS detector uses a right handed coordinate system with the origin at the
nominal interaction point with the $z$-axis along the beam direction and the
$xy$ plane orthogonal to it. The positive $x$-axis goes from the interaction
point to the center of the LHC ring and the positive $y$-axis is defined as
pointing upwards. The A-side of the detector is defined as that with a positive
$z$-axis while the C-side has the negative $z$-axis.

The LHC beam are unpolarized and thus invariant under rotations around the beam
line axis, a cylindrical coordinate system is particularly convenient to
describe the detector geometry where:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:57}
  r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \phi = \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x}.
\end{equation}
A momentum dependent coordinate, the \emph{rapidity}, is commonly used in
particle physics for its properties under Lorentz transformations. The rapidity
is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:58}
  Y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{E + p_z}{E - p_z}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the energy of the particle and $p_z$ its momentum along the
$z$-axis. Rapidity interval are Lorentz invariant and in the relativistic limit
or when the mass of the particle is negligible, the rapidity only depends on the
production angle of the particle with respect to the beam axis,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:59}
  \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{r}{z}.
\end{equation}
This approximation is called \gls{eta} and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:60}
  Y \xrightarrow{p \gg m} \eta = - \ln \left( \tan \frac{\theta}{2} \right).
\end{equation}
A value of $\theta = 90^{\circ}$, perpendicular to the beam axis, corresponds to
$\eta = 0$. The spatial separation between particles in the detector is commonly
given in terms of a Lorentz invariant variable defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:61}
  \Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta \phi^2 + \Delta \eta^2}.
\end{equation}

Other quantities used to describe the kinematics of the $pp$ interaction are the
\gls{pt} and the \gls{et} defined as $\pt = p \sin \theta$ and
$\et = E \sin \theta$ respectively.

The ATLAS forward region is covered by three smaller detectors: the \gls{lucid},
the \gls{alfa} and the \gls{zdc}. LUCID is located at $\pm 17$~m from the IP, it
is designed to monitor the relative luminosity (\textbf{relative to what?}) by
detecting the inelastic $pp$ scattering. The ZDC is located at $\pm 140$~m from
the IP, it consists of alternating layers of quartz rods and tungsten plates
designed to measure neutron at $|\eta| < 8.2$, its purpose is to measure the
centrality in heavy-ion collisions. ALFA is located at $\pm 240$~m and is
designed to measure the absolute luminosity via elastic scattering at small
angles.

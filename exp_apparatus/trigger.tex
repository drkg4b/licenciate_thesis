The bunch crossing rate at LHC is 40~MHz for a bunch spacing of 25~$\mu$s (about
7 meters), in reality there are several bigger gaps bringing this rate down to
$\approx 31$~MHz. Each event recorded by ATLAS require $\approx 1.4$~MB of disk
space, with approximately 20 to 50 collisions per bunch crossing, the storage
space required to record all the events would be $\approx 60$~TB/s. This is not
feasible thus only the most interesting events are selected and stored on
disk. The \emph{trigger system} decides whether to keep or not a collision event
for later studies, it consists of a hardware based \gls{l1} trigger and a
software based \gls{hlt}.

The L1 trigger determines \gls{rois} in the detector using custom hardware and
coarse information from the calorimeter and the muon system. The L1 trigger is
capable of reducing the event rate to 100~kHz with a decision time for a L1
accept of 2.5~$\mu$s. The RoIs from the L1 trigger are sent to the HLT where
different algorithms are run using the full detector information and reducing
the L1 output rate to 1~kHz with a processing time of 200~ms~\cite{trigger}. A
schematic overview of the ATLAS trigger and data acquisition system is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:trigger_system}.

In this analysis the HLT\_xe70 trigger has been used, it receives an L1 accept
that selects events with a missing energy (see
Section~\ref{sec:miss-transv-energy}) greater than 50~GeV, no muons are used in
the reconstruction of the missing energy. At the HLT level, events with a
missing energy greater than 70~GeV are then selected. (\textbf{Are at the HLT
  level the muon used? Otherwise, what's the point of this cut? Couldn't the
  event be selected directly using a 70 GeV cut at L1?})

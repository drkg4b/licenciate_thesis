The results of the search for new physics phenomena in a monojet with large
missing transverse momentum using the data from $pp$ collisions at LHC collected
by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 and corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 3.2~$\ifb$ have been presented. No significant excess in the data
compared to the SM predictions has been found thus the results have been
translated into model independent upper limits on the visible cross section with
a 95\% CL and interpreted in terms of squark pair production with
$\squarkprod$. Squark masses up to 608~GeV are excluded.

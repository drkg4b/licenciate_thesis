The $\wenuplusjets$ can pass the signal region selection, thus contributing to
the background, in case the electron is not identified in the detector. This
region is designed to constrain the $\wenuplusjets$ and $\wtaunuplusjets$
processes and estimate their contribution to the background in the signal
region.

Systematic uncertainties can originate from the theory, caused for example by
our limited knowledge of the parton distribution function, or from experimental
sources such as the absolute jet energy scale and resolution determination. The
systematic uncertainties are treated as Gaussian nuisance parameters in the
global likelihood fit described in Section~\ref{sec:glob-simult-likel}.

The $\znunu$~+~jets SM process where the jets are produced by \gls{isr} and the
neutrinos escape detection generating large $\met$ is topologically equivalent
to signal events expected in the search for physics beyond standard model with a
monojet signature in the final state. This process constitutes an irreducible
and the most relevant \gls{bg} in the monojet analysis. The second biggest
source of background with a monojet topology is the
$W (\rightarrow \ell \nu)$~+~jets, where $W (\rightarrow \tau \nu)$~+~jets, in
which the $\tau$ decays hadronically, gives the highest contribution to this
class of events. The rest of the $W$~+~jets event can fake a monojet signature
if the lepton escape the detector acceptance or the lepton veto. Other processes
that can have final states with jets and leptons and thus constitutes a BG in
the monojet analysis are di-boson, $t \bar{t}$ and single top
processes. Multi-jet production from QCD processes where one or more jets are
mis-reconstructed leading to high $\met$ represent a small source of
BG\@. Finally \gls{ncb} coming from cosmic particles, detector noise and
beam-induced BG can give rise to fake jets and consequently to $\met$.

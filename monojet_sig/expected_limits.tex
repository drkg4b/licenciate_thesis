Since in the compressed SUSY models the $\met$ recoils typically against several
jets, the average jet momenta are lower than the missing energy, thus requiring
an asymmetric cut on the leading jet momentum and $\met$ to capture this
signal. A signal region (AM1) with $\met > 700$~GeV and leading jet
$\pt > 300$~GeV was defined and compared with the IM1 signal region. The results
for an integrated luminosity of L = 3.2~$\ifb$ for these two signal regions is
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:im1_straight_comparison}, a model is excludable if
the signal strength $\mu$, depicted by the color scale in the picture, is lower
than one. The sensitivity improves for the signal region AM1 to reflect the
asymmetric kinematics.

    luminosity of L=3.3\ifb ~in the plane defined by the squark mass
    $m_{\tilde{q}}$ and the mass difference between the squark mass and the

    $\Delta m = m(\tilde{q}) - m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})$. The color scale
    reflects the lowest excludable signal strength for a particular mass
    point. The values indicated on the map indicate the actual excludable $\mu$
    values at a some specific SUSY models. The dashed line shows the limit
    between excludable and not excludable models. The theoretical uncertainties
    in the signal are not included.}

In the AM1 signal region, models with mass gaps $\Delta m = 5$~GeV between the
squark mass and the neutralino mass, can be excluded up to squark masses of
650~GeV. At a larger mass gap of $\Delta m = 25$~GeV, squark masses up to
580~GeV are excludable.

The performance of the shape fit method were also tested on the SUSY compressed
spectra; a comparison with the AM1 signal region, is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:shape_straight_comparison}, the shape fit method improves the
expected limits especially for the largest mass gap of $\Delta m = 25$~GeV
between the squark and the neutralino masses, the AM1 region was thus dropped.

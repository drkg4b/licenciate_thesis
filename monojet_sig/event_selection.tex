The search is carried out in $pp$ collisions using the data collected by the
ATLAS experiment during the 2015 Run II corresponding to a total integrated
luminosity of 3.2 \ifb. The signal region is defined by the following selection
criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item The HLT\_xe70 trigger was used in the whole 2015 dataset.
\item In order to assure that the event originated from a $pp$ collision, a PV
  with at least two associated tracks with $\pt > 0.4$~GeV is required.
\item Events in which any jet fails the \emph{loose} jet cleaning criteria are
  rejected. This suppress noise from non-collision background.
\item The most energetic jet in the event (the \emph{leading jet}) must have
  $\pt > 250~$GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$. Moreover, in order to reject beam-induced
  and cosmic particles background, the event is rejected if the leading jet
  fails the \emph{tight} cleaning criteria.
\item In order to suppress $Z (\rightarrow \ell \bar{\ell})$ + jets and
  $W (\rightarrow \ell \nu)$ background, events with an identified electron of
  $\pt > 20~$GeV or muon of $\pt > 10~$GeV are rejected.
\item In order not to overlap with other analyses, events with more than four
  jets are rejected, see Appendix~\ref{sec:jet-veto} for more details on this
  selection.
\item The $\met$ trigger can acquire multi-jet events in case of a
  mis-reconstructed jet, since in these cases, usually, the missing transverse
  momentum points in the direction of one of the jets, this background can be
  suppressed by imposing a minimum azimuthal angle separation between the
  missing transverse momentum and any jet of 0.4.
\item The $\met$ trigger is fully efficient at 250~GeV, thus a $\met > 250~$GeV
  requirement is imposed.
\end{itemize}

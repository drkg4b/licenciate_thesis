No significant excess of data over background is observed thus the results of
the global fit procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:glob-simult-likel} are
used to set model independent exclusion limit (see
Section~\ref{sec:model-indep-limits}) and interpreted in terms of squark pair
production with $\widetilde{q} \rightarrow q + \widetilde{\chi}_1^0\, (q = u,\,
d,\, c,\, s)$ (see Section~\ref{sec:interpretation}).

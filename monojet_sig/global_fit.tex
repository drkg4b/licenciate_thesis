A pure MC based prediction of the background contamination in the signal region
would suffer from large theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties in
the shape and normalization of the predicted distributions, thus a data driven
approach, where the different backgrounds are normalized using the data in CRs
that are orthogonal to the SR, is used. To extrapolate from CR to SR prediction
an MC based \emph{transfer factor} is used. This factor is a ratio of MC
predictions thus most of the systematic uncertainties either cancel out or are
significantly reduced. The extrapolation from one kinematic region to another
can be itself source of uncertainties, to avoid this, the selection in terms of
kinematic in the CRs and SRs is chosen to be the same.

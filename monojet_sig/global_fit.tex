A pure MC based prediction of the background contamination in the signal region
would suffer from large theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties in
the shape and normalization of the predicted distributions, thus a data driven
approach, where the different backgrounds are normalized using the data in CRs
that are orthogonal to the SR, is used. To extrapolate from CR to SR prediction
an MC based \emph{transfer factor} is used. This factor is a ratio of MC
predictions thus most of the systematic uncertainties either cancel out or are
significantly reduced. The extrapolation from one kinematic region to another
can be itself source of uncertainties, to avoid this, the selection in terms of
kinematic in the CRs and SRs is chosen to be the same. The expected
contributions of a background process BG$_i$, which is extracted from a control
region CR$_j$ dominated by background BG$_j$, to a signal region SR$_k$, is
given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:83}
  N_{\mathrm{\, BG}_i}^{\mathrm{\, SR}_k} = \frac{(N_\mathrm{\,
      data}^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j} - N_\mathrm{\, other~BG,~MC}^{\mathrm{\,
        CR}_j})}{N^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_j \mathrm{,~MC}}} \times
  N^{\mathrm{\, SR}_k}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_i,~\mathrm{MC}}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathrm{\, BG}_i}^{\mathrm{\, SR}_k}$ is the predicted number of the
background $i$ events in the $k$ signal region,
$N_\mathrm{\, data}^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j}$ is the observed number of events in the
$j$ control region, $N_\mathrm{\, other~BG,~MC}^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j}$ is the MC
estimate of the background contamination coming from other processes in the
given control region, $N^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_j \mathrm{,~MC}}$ is
the MC prediction of the $j$ background in the $j$ control region and
$N^{\mathrm{\, SR}_k}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_i,~\mathrm{MC}}$ is the number of the $i$
background events predicted in MC simulation in the signal region. The ratio:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:84}
  C_{\mathrm{BG}_i}^{\mathrm{CR}_j \rightarrow \mathrm{SR}_k} = \frac{
    N^{\mathrm{\, SR}_k}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_i,~\mathrm{MC}}}{N^{\mathrm{\,
        CR}_j}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_j \mathrm{,~MC}}}
\end{equation}
is the transfer factor used to extrapolate from CR$_j$ to SR$_k$. The
normalization factors used in the normalization of the BG expectation in the SRs
is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:85}
  \mu_{ijk} = \frac{(N_\mathrm{\, data}^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j} - N_\mathrm{\,
      other~BG,~MC}^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j})}{N^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j}_{\mathrm{\, BG}_j
      \mathrm{,~MC}}}.
\end{equation}
The different normalization factors are not independent since different
processes can enter different CRs and thus the background subtraction term,
$N_\mathrm{\, other~BG,~MC}^{\mathrm{\, CR}_j}$, gets contributions from the
other normalization factors. To properly treat the correlations, the
normalization factors are obtained from a simultaneous fit of all the CRs
referred to as the \emph{global fit}. A summary of the different processes and
the corresponding CR used to extract the normalization factor is given in
Table~\ref{tab:norm_factors}.

The global fit is performed in a background only hypothesis in all the inclusive
signal regions (IM1--IM7) defined in Section~\ref{sec:event-selection}
constraining $7 \times 3 = 21$ normalization factors at once. In addition a fit
on the exclusive signal regions (EM1--EM6) in a signal plus background
hypothesis is performed in which 3 normalization factors are fitted
independently for each inclusive $\met$ bin.

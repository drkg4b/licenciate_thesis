The $V$ + jets, where $V$ is either a $W$ or a $Z$ vector boson, constitutes the
main BG of the monojet analysis. A pure MC estimation of these processes,
suffers from theoretical uncertainties like the limited knowledge of the
\glspl{pdf} and experimental ones related to the JES and luminosity
determination. In order to estimate the contribution of these BGs in the SR, a
\emph{data driven} technique was used. The method aims at reducing the
systematic uncertainties by relying on information from data in the CRs rather
than on MC simulations. It can be divided in three major steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define CRs to select $V$ + jets event in data.
\item Calculate a conversion factor from MC observed events in the CR to BG
  estimates in the SR\@.
\item Apply the conversion factor to the observed events in the CR to obtain the
  estimate number of events from the process in the SR\@.
\end{itemize}
The CRs used to constrain the $V$ + jets BGs have an event selection that
differs from the SR only in the lepton veto and the missing transverse momentum
calculation. They are thus orthogonal to the SR and a minimum contribution from
a monojet-like signal is expected.

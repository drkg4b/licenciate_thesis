- Other ways to detect dark matter?

- Other motivation for SUSY (CP violation, Sakharov, GUT)

- Why is important that pseudorapidity intervals are invariant:

  The momentum of the parton is not known. Two partons colliding in opposite
  directions can have any range of momentum from 0 to the sum of the momenta
  they had so the (spread along z axis... elaborate)

- What is a PV and a secondary vertex?

- Give and example of homogeneous calorimeter, what are the benefits?

- Why LAr has an accordion shape, why we use LAr?

- Why TileCal in barrel and LAr in forward regions?

- How to measure absolute luminosity?

- Strenghts and weaknesses of ATLAS and CMS

- Why neutrinos cannot be dark matter candidates?

  Can deduct the kinematic of particles from temperature. Neturino masses are
  small and thus they have a lot of kinetic energy (from the big bang), from
  simulations it can be seen that the gravitational pull is not enough to bound
  them in galaxies thus we need something heavier than neutrinos.

- How can we generate so much MC events to simulate for all the data we collect?

  We generate selected processes with smaller cross sections and not the whole
  possibles pp collision outcomes.

- Why some group chose a set of working points (jvt)

  Its a compromise between efficiency and purity of samples. Generally more than
  one working point is provided to accomodate the need of all the different
  analysis.

- The difference between different MC generators?

  They have different hadronization models (empirical because qcd is not
  perturbative anymore at the energy scale when quarks and gluons hadronize).

- How does SCT measure the PV and secondary vertex? Is what they really do
  directly or is done indirectly? How?

- Why there is no excess in the high met at 13 TeV? Is it because at 8 TeV was
  just a fluctuation? Is it because of the increased energy?

- Why do you think you have contributed enough for a Ph.D?

- What do your different models solve and not solve, with respect to the SM
  problems you have formulated in chapter 1? How do your limits play into that?

- Why do you quote neutrino masses for the flavor eigenstates?

- How do you give masses to the neutrinos?

- Is there more physics predicted from the ADD model? Do we expect other
  particles?

- Is the diphoton excess compatible with a graviton model? With your graviton
  model?

- Why are we even doing monophotons when monojet always provides better
  sensitivity?

- Why do the DM plots look the way they do? Eg. why do the sensitivity go to
  zero at low wimp mass, and decrease again for high wimp masses? Do all these
  experiments make the same assumptions?

- What is an axial-vector mediator?

- Does SUSY solve naturalness at the current limits?

- What is naturalness good for? Seeing that it motivates most of your
  searches. Has naturalness ever motivated a discovery before?

- Can you get the proper relic density with neutralinos? With UED? With
  gravitinos?

- Is the graviton interaction really an effective interaction? The Feynman
  diagrams donâ€™t look that way.

- What is a general-purpose detector? Can it make coffee? (Here I think the
  answer is yes, but you would probably not want to drink it)

- How do the new LVPS affect other things? Such as for example the timing?

- Is the non-iterative OF a lot worse in terms of performance than the
  iterative?

- Why can you not create b or c quarks in hadronization?

- Why does our 8 TeV trigger plateau earlier than the 13 TeV trigger?

- How do we actually measure the efficiency of a trigger?

- Why did we increase the number of jets from the 7 TeV analysis?

- When is it better to use one region and not a multi-region fit?

- Why do we use renorm and fact scale times 0.5 and 2 for systematics?

- How do we determine how many events to generate?

- The Pythia settings - are they tested on SM physics so we know what to expcect
  for radiation?

- What is the pros and cons for the two different ways of estimating the top
  systematics?

- What are the pros and cons of BLUE vs the Likelihood metod?

- Your control regions in the 8 TeV analysis clearly perform worse at high
  MET. Why should we then trust the background estimate at high MET? And do you
  understand why you had this problem at 8 TeV and not at 13 TeV?

The color-carrying quarks and gluons, created in the scattering process, undergo
the hadronization process which produces collimated bunches of colorless hadrons
(jets) which keep track of the energy and the direction of the originating
parton. Jets in ATLAS are reconstructed as massless particles using the
\emph{$\antikt$} algorithm, calibrated and corrected for pile-up
contamination. These steps are briefly outlined in the next sections.

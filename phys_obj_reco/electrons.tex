Electrons are identified in the central part of the ATLAS detector
($|\eta| < 2.47$) by an energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter and an
associated track in the inner detector. Electron identification efficiencies are
measured in $pp$ collisions data and compared to efficiencies measured in $\zee$
simulations. Signal electrons are identified by different sets of
likelihood-based criteria with $\sim 95\%, \sim 90\%$ and $\sim 80\%$ efficiency
for electrons with $\pt \sim 40~$GeV, the different criteria are referred to as
\emph{loose}, \emph{medium} and \emph{tight} operating points
respectively\cite{ATL-EL-IDENT}.

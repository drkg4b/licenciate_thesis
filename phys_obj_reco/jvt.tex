The excess transverse energy coming from pile-up jets is generally subtracted on
average from the signal energy, however, due to localized fluctuations in the
pile-up, some pile-up jet remains. The \gls{jvf} is a variable that uses
information from the track associated to each jet to identify the origin vertex
of each jet and reject it if not coming from a hard-scatter
vertex~\cite{JVF}. The JVF can be regarded as a measure of the fraction of the
jet energy associated with a primary vertex and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:77}
  \mathrm{JVF} = \frac{\sum_k p_\mathrm{\, T}^\mathrm{\, trk_k}
    (\mathrm{PV_0})}{\sum_l p_\mathrm{\, T}^\mathrm{\, trk_l} (\mathrm{PV_0}) +
    \sum_{n \geq l} \sum_k p_\mathrm{\, T}^\mathrm{\, trk_l} (\mathrm{PV_n})}
\end{equation}
where PV$_0$ is the primary vertex and PV$_n$ with $n \geq 1$ is any other
pile-up PV in the same bunch crossing.

Since the JVF denominator increases with the number of reconstructed PV, this
introduces a pile-up dependence on the number of PV when minimal JVF criterion
are imposed in rejecting pile-up jets. To address this problem, two new
variables to separate from \gls{hs} and \gls{pu} jets are introduced:
$\mathrm{corrJVF}$ and $\mathrm{R_{pT}}$. The former is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:78}
  \mathrm{corrJVF} = \frac{\pt^{\mathrm{\, HS}}}{\pt^{\, \mathrm{HS}} +
    \pt^{\, \mathrm{PU, corr}}}
\end{equation}
where
$\pt^{\mathrm{\, HS}} = \sum_k p_\mathrm{\, T}^\mathrm{\, trk_k}
(\mathrm{PV_0})$
is the scalar sum of the $\pt$ of the tracks associated with the jet that comes
from the HS vertex and
$\pt^{\, \mathrm{PU, corr}} = \sum_{n \geq l} \sum_k p_\mathrm{\, T}^\mathrm{\,
  trk_l} (\mathrm{PV_n}) / (k n_{\mathrm{trk}}^{\mathrm{PU}})$
is the scalar sum of the associated tracks originating from a pile-up
vertex. Since the average $\pt^{\mathrm{PU}}$ increases linearly with the number
of pile-up tracks, $n_{\mathrm{trk}}^{\mathrm{PU}}$, $\pt^{\mathrm{PU}}$ is
divided by $(kn_{\mathrm{trk}}^{\mathrm{PU}})$ where $k = 0.01$ is the slope of
the $\langle \pt^{\mathrm{PU}} \rangle$ dependence with
$n_{\mathrm{trk}}^{\mathrm{PU}}$~\cite{JVT}. The corrJVF corrects the
N$_\mathrm{PV}$ dependence in the JVF denominator.

The $\mathrm{R_{pT}}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:79}
  \mathrm{R_{pT}} = \frac{\sum_k p_\mathrm{\, T}^\mathrm{\, trk_k}
    (\mathrm{PV_0})}{\pt^{\mathrm{jet}}}
\end{equation}
where $\pt^{\mathrm{jet}}$ is the fully calibrated jet $\pt$. This variable is
defined using tracks associated with the HS vertex, thus it is independent on
the N$_{\mathrm{PV}}$~\cite{PileUpPerformance}.

The \gls{jvt} is constructed from the corrJVF and $\mathrm{R_{pT}}$ by forming a
two dimensional likelihood

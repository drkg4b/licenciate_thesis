The cell noise (see Section~\ref{sec:cell-noise}) is used in the baseline
algorithm, the \emph{topological clustering} algorithm~\cite{JetCluster}, for
the identification of the energy deposits. The algorithm assumes that the noise
in all the calorimeter cells is normally distributed with significance (the
ratio between the deposited energy and the parameter $\sigma$ used to describe
the cell noise) expressed in units of Gaussian sigmas. In the algorithm, cluster
of cells called \emph{topoclusters}, are formed by testing the energy deposit in
a cell for a significant incompatibility with a noise only hypothesis. The
algorithm starts by finding the \emph{seed cells} with $E > 4 \sigma$ where
$\sigma$ is the measured RMS of the energy distribution for every cell in the
pedestal run. The second step is to add to the seeds neighbor cells that satisfy
the $E > 2 \sigma$ condition. Finally an additional layer of cells with $E > 0$
is added to the perimeter of the cluster before applying the splitting algorithm
to separate the topoclusters based on the local energy maxima.

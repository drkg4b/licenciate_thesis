In $pp$ collisions with high luminosity, multiple interactions occur on a given
bunch crossing, the space location of the collision is called \emph{vertex} and
the the hard scatter vertex (the one that has the highest $\sum \pt^2$ of
constituent tracks) that triggered the recording of the event is called
\gls{pv}, the rest are called \emph{pile-up vertices}. The reconstruction of the
PV generally happens in two stages that are often not distinguishable from each
other. The \emph{vertex finding} associates reconstructed tracks to a particular
vertex candidate and the \emph{vertex fitting} reconstructs the actual vertex
position, refits the incident tracks and estimates the quality of the
fit~\cite{PV}.

In the current analysis events are required to have at least one PV with two
associated tracks.

This analysis uses electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse momentum
($\met$). Two types of electrons, muons and jets are also defined: \emph{baseline}
and \emph{good}, where the former one is used for overlap removal and
preselection while the latter for selecting the objects used to define the
signal and control regions. In the following a brief introduction to the
identification criteria is presented.
